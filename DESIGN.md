# Design

## Language and tooling
- use idiomatic Swift
- use xCode compatible project structure
- minimise the use of external dependencies
- target iOS 26 and above

## Product constraints
- Solver is offline-only: shipped features must not require network access at runtime.
- Prefer bundled datasets and on-device processing for search, lookup, ranking, and preferences.
- Design features so they degrade by scope, not connectivity; if data is unavailable locally, the UI should explain that clearly rather than attempting an online fallback.
